        "Grey-Level Co-occurance Matrices (GLCMs) are a way to collect statistics about how much contrast there is between neighbouring pixels in an image. Thus, GLCM is a good way to distinguish textures from one another. A texture is usually a small patch of an image, but we can use the same process on an entire image at once to create global features for image classification, too.\n",
